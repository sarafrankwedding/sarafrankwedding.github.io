<p><strong> Will kippot be provided? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p><strong> Can non-Jews wear kippot during the ceremony?  </strong></p>
<p>Of course! Anyone who wishes to wear a kippah is welcome to do so. </p>
<p><strong> What is a chuppah? What will our chuppah be made of? </strong></p>
<p>A chuppah is the canopy under which we will stand during our wedding ceremony. It represents the new home we will build together. Our chuppah was made by Saraâ€™s parents, Judy and Mark, and will be supported by our friends and family. It will be decorated with flowers and prayer shawls from our families. </p>

<p><strong> What happens during a Jewish wedding ceremony? </strong></p>
<p>First, there is the hakafot, or circling, in which the bride and groom will circle each other seven times. Seven represents the number of days of creation, and our marriage is an act of creation as well.</p>
<p>Next, there will be blessings over the bond of marriage, followed by the exchange of vows and rings. Rings are traditionally placed on the couple's pointer fingers (not ring fingers), because of an ancient belief that the pointer finger is connected directly to the heart.</p>
<p>After some words by our officiant, Rabbi Ira Dounn, we will continue with the Sheva Brachot, which means "seven blessings." These blessings over the marriage are connected to the themes of creation and celebration. They will be read both in Hebrew and in English by our friends and family.</p>
<p>Next comes the Birkhat Kohanim (priestly blessing), which will be given by *****. In ancient times, this blessing was given by the Kohanim (priests) over everyone. In modern times, the blessing is often recited by parents over their children on Shabbat.</p>
<p>Finally, we will break a glass, symbolizing the fact that even at our most joyous occasions we must remember the continued brokenness of the world.</p>
-->
<p><strong> What is a yichud? </strong></p>
<p>The yichud is the traditional period of seclusion in which the newlyweds spend the first few minutes of marriage alone together, immediately after the ceremony. After the yichud, we will join the celebration!</p>
<p><strong>Why will the bride and groom be lifted on chairs during the celebratory dancing?</strong></p>
<p>Tradition!</p>
