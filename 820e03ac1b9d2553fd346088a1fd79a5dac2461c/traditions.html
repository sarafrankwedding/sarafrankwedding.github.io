<p><strong> Breaking the glass </strong></p>
<p>Near the close of a Jewish wedding, the groom breaks a small glass, reminding us that even in the happiest of times we must not forget our responsibility of Tikkun Olam (repairing brokenness in the world). </p>
<p><strong> Chuppah </strong></p>
<p>The chuppah is the canopy under which Sara and Frank will stand during the wedding ceremony. It represents the new home they will build together. This chuppah was made by Sara's parents and is decorated with tallitot from Charles Keil and Irwin Fridovich (Sara's grandfathers), Isadore Silverman (Sara's great-grandfather), and a shawl patterned after a traditional Chinese design on display at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan. </p>
<p><strong> Hakafot </strong></p>
<p> During the hakafot ("circling"), Sara and Frank will circle each other seven times (3 each + 1 together). Seven represents the days of creation, and marriage is an act of creation as well. </p>
<p><strong> Hora </strong></p>
<p> The hora is an Ashkenazi Jewish circle dance of celebration traditionally accompanied by klezmer music. During the hora, it is customary for the bride and groom to be lifted on chairs within the circle, as a symbol of the newlyweds' elevation and joy. </p>
<p><strong> Ketubah </strong></p>
<p> The ketubah is a traditional Jewish marriage contract. Sara and Frank's ketubah (on display inside the house) was signed by them, 2 witnesses, and Rabbi Ira Dounn before the wedding ceremony. </p>
<p><strong> Kiddush </strong></p>
<p> The Kiddush is a Jewish blessing and prayer recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Sabbath, Jewish holidays, and important milestones in life. The kiddush cup used in the ceremony originally belonged to Max Keil, Sara's great-great-grandfather. </p>
<p><strong> Kiddushin </strong></p>
<p> In Jewish law, kiddushin ("betrothal") is the stage of a Jewish wedding in which the bride and groom mutually promise to marry each other by exchanging rings and reciting in Hebrew: "You are holy to me as my husband/wife, in accordance with the tradition of Moses and Israel." </p>
<p><strong> Kippot </strong></p>
<p> Kippot (singular kippah) are brimless caps worn on the head as a sign of respect for G-d by all in attendance who wish to wear one. </p>
<p><strong> Ring Design </strong></p>
<p> The ring design on the cover of this program includes Sara's and Frank's Hebrew names (Zahava Chaya and Gil) connected by modified lemniscate (infinity) symbols. </p>
<p><strong> Tallit </strong></p>
<p> Tallitot (plural of “tallit”) are traditional Jewish prayer shawls. </p>
<!--
<p><strong> What happens during a Jewish wedding ceremony? </strong></p>
<p>First, there is the hakafot, or circling, in which the bride and groom will circle each other seven times. Seven represents the number of days of creation, and our marriage is an act of creation as well.</p>
<p>Next, there will be blessings over the bond of marriage, followed by the exchange of vows and rings. Rings are traditionally placed on the couple’s pointer fingers (not ring fingers), because of an ancient belief that the pointer finger is connected directly to the heart.</p>
<p>After some words by our officiant, Rabbi Ira Dounn, we will continue with the Sheva Brachot, which means “seven blessings.” These blessings over the marriage are connected to the themes of creation and celebration. They will be read both in Hebrew and in English by our friends and family.</p>
<p>Next comes the Birkhat Kohanim (priestly blessing), which will be given by *****. In ancient times, this blessing was given by the Kohanim (priests) over everyone. In modern times, the blessing is often recited by parents over their children on Shabbat.</p>
<p>Finally, we will break a glass, symbolizing the fact that even at our most joyous occasions we must remember the continued brokenness of the world.</p>
-->
<p><strong> Yichud </strong></p>
<p>The yichud is the traditional period of seclusion during which the newlyweds spend their first few minutes of marriage alone together, immediately after the ceremony. After the yichud, Sara and Frank will rejoin the celebration!</p>
