<p><strong> Local Airports </strong></p>
<p>The 2 large airports most convenient to Princeton are Philadelphia International (PHL) and Newark Liberty International (EWR). There is also a small airport much closer to Princeton (Trenton-Mercer, TTN) that is used by Frontier airlines. The flight options tend to be limited, but if you find one that works for you it may be a good option. </p> <br>
<p><strong> Parking at the wedding venue </strong></p>
<p><b>Important:</b> There are 2 parking lots available for our use: a small lot very near the house, and a large lot about Â½ mile away (accessible from Mountain Avenue, right next to the long driveway at 57 Mountain Avenue leading to the Mountain Lakes House). To ensure those with special needs can park close to the house, we are asking that everyone else please park in the larger lot near Mountain Avenue and catch a ride with someone who can shuttle them up the driveway to the house. If you plan to drive to the venue and are willing to make one or 2 trips between the large parking lot and the house shuttling guests who park in the large lot, please email Judy at jfridov@emory.edu. To be clear, we will need shuttlers both before and after the wedding, so please specify which time frame would work better for you.  Thank you!
