<p><strong> Will kippot be provided? Can non-Jews wear kippot during the ceremony? Is a kippah the same thing as a yarmulke? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, but feel free to bring your own. Sure, if you&#39;d like! And yes, &quot;yarmulke&quot; is the Yiddish word for it and &quot;kippah&quot; is the Hebrew (and &quot;kippot&quot; is the plural form).   </p>
<p><strong> What is a chuppah? What will your chuppah be made of? </strong></p>
<p>The chuppah is the canopy under which we will stand during our wedding ceremony. It represents the new home we will build together. Our chuppah will be made of Ben&#39;s father&#39;s tallit (traditional shawl worn during prayer), under which Ben&#39;s parents Pam and Dean were also married.</p>
<p><strong> What happens during a Jewish wedding ceremony? </strong></p>
<p>First, there is the hakafot, or circling, in which the bride and groom will circle each other seven times. Seven represents the number of days of creation, and our marriage is an act of creation as well.</p>
<p>Next, there will be blessings over wine and over the bond of marriage, followed by the exchange of vows and rings. Rings are traditionally placed on the couple&#39;s pointer fingers (not ring fingers), because of an ancient belief that the pointer finger is connected directly to the heart.</p>
<p>After some words by our officiant, Rabbi Julie Roth, we&#39;ll continue with the Sheva Brachot, which means &quot;seven blessings.&quot; These blessings over the marriage are connected to the themes of creation and of celebration. They will be read in Hebrew by Cantor Jill Pakman with a traditional melody, and our parents and grandparents will give English translations or blessings.</p>
<p>Next comes the Birkhat Kohanim (priestly blessing), which will be given by Rabbi Beth Janus, Ben&#39;s aunt. In ancient times, this blessing was given by the Kohanim (priests) over everyone. In less ancient times, the blessing is traditionally said over one&#39;s children on Shabbat.</p>
<p>Finally, we will break a glass, symbolizing the fact that even at our most joyous occasions we also remember the continued brokenness of the world.</p>
<p><strong> What&#39;s a yichud? </strong></p>
<p>The yichud is the traditional period of seclusion in which the newlyweds spend the first few minutes of marriage alone together, immediately after the ceremony. Then we&#39;ll join the cocktail hour!</p>
<p><strong>Why will the bride and groom be lifted on chairs during the celebratory dancing?</strong></p>
<p>Tradition! [Cue Fiddler on the Roof]</p>
