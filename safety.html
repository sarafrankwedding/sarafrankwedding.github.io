            <h3 class="center">Indoors/Outdoors</h3>
            <p>We are planning on holding the wedding outside unless the weather makes this impossible. Specifically, we plan to hold the ceremony outdoors, the cocktail hour outdoors and indoors, and the reception in a spacious tent with a high ceiling.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="center">Masks</h3>
            <p>As of two weeks before the wedding, we're not planning to require guests to wear masks, but this could change, especially depending on weather affecting where the wedding is held. Please bring a mask just in case! We will bring extra masks for those who do not bring their own.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="center">Vaccination</h3>
            <p>All guests over age 12, as well as the musicians, photographer, and videographer, will be vaccinated. The venue staff may or may not be vaccinated but will be masked. Children under age 12 will be asked to take COVID tests within 3 days before the wedding.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you have coronavirus safety concerns, please feel free to reach out to us at <a href = "mailto: benjenny100@gmail.com">benjenny100@gmail.com</a>. Our final guest count is due Monday 8/16, so if possible please let us know before that date if you won't be able to come for coronavirus safety reasons or otherwise.</p>
            <p>And of course, if you are not feeling well, please stay home! We will miss you but we'll be grateful for your help in making sure our wedding is safe.</p>
